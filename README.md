# üîç MY ADVENTURE STARTS HERE ...

In this AI things era. The AI is getting smarter but most of us, not. Instead of learning, we are leaning to the AI to improve our result without improve ourself. By the end of the day, we get nothing but short memories that enforce us to ask again and again about something that we have previously asked. It is good to boost our work by integrating AI into it, but it is better if we know what this AI can do, what we can do better.

This project is developed to help musceling my brain to keep being sharp in the middle of these AI things!
